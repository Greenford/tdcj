#TDCJ Inmate Scraping
## Background and Motivation
The Texas Department of Criminal Justice is the state's prison agency, and Texas itself is single state in the US with the largest number of prisoners, having more than 150 thousand not counting the federal prisons and county jails. Having volunteered at the Inside Books Project, a books-to-prison project serving only inmates in Texas, I have a variety of interests in the lives of prisoners. 

TDCJ Makes the individual data of prisoners available for anyone who knows their name or TDCJ ID number. I want to answer questions about the data as a whole. 

With this purpose, I've made a web scraper to capture all of the data on TDCJ inmates, and have done a sample analysis of the data. 

## Hypothesis
Racial discrimination has seemed especially prominent in the criminal justice system. I wanted to see if there was a detectable difference in treatment between the TDCJ population along lines of recorded race. The metric I chose to investigate was sentence length. I chose to separate my investigations between crimes, as I imagine the sentences for murder and other violent heinous crimes wouldn't be comparable to lesser nonviolent ones such as possession of a controlled substance. I chose to limit the scope of my analysis to 5 most common nonviolent crimes. 

Null Hypothesis: The mean sentence date per crime is the same across every race. 

Alternate Hypothesis: The mean sentence date per crime is different for each race.
